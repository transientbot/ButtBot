            Set the amount of time that someone can be silent in chat and still receive channel currency.  Set these to 0 to allow everyone in chat to receive currency regardless of activity.

            <div class="form-group" onkeypress="return event.keyCode != 13">
                <label for="idleCurrencyIntervalInputHours">Activity Level for Currency</label>
                <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary inline pull-right" onClick="$.updateCurrencyActivityLevel('#idleCurrencyIntervalInputHours', '#idleCurrencyIntervalInputMinutes', '#idleCurrencyIntervalInputSeconds')">Update</button>
                <input type="number" min="0" value="0" class="form-control" id="idleCurrencyIntervalInputHours" placeholder="Hours" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Set the interval (in hours) before a user is considered too idle to receive channel currency." />

            <br />

            Set the number of points that a user will receive when they have been silent for the above duration.  Setting a value higher than your points per interval will result in idlers receiving more points than active chatters, and setting a value lower than 0 will penalize users points every interval.  Points may drop below 0.  This value will only be awarded while you are live; while you are offline, all users will receive your full offline points value.

            Set the amount of time that someone can be silent in chat and still be targeted by (random) commands.  Set these to 0 to allow everyone in chat to be targeted by (random) commands regardless of activity.

                <label for="idleRandomIntervalInputHours">Activity Level for (random)</label>
